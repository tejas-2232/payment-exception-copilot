# Payment exception investigation assistant

A personal, fictional, read-only prototype. This first slice lets an analyst inspect five sample cases; recommendations and procedure search are not implemented yet. It does not represent a real bank or its policies.

## Run locally
Requires Python 3.10 or newer. From the repository root:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.api.main:app --reload
```

In a second terminal, activate the same environment and run `streamlit run app/ui/dashboard.py`. The dashboard connects to the API on port 8000; set `CASE_API_URL` to change the API address. Run `pytest` and `ruff check .` for offline checks. All examples are fictional; see [data card](data/DATA_CARD.md) and [discovery](docs/discovery.md).
